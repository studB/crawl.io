# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 coarse phases — Config Parser → Core Crawler + Output → Naver Auth + Session → CLI + Packaging
- Config: Markdown sections (`# URL`, `# Selectors`, `# Rules`, `# Output`), YAML-in-code-blocks for structured fields
- Auth: Credentials via `NAVER_ID`/`NAVER_PW` env vars; storage state persisted to `.crawl-session.json`
- Testing: Real Naver Cafe URLs (no local fixtures — deliberate fidelity tradeoff)
